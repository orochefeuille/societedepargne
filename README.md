## "Développeur Web et Web Mobile" - week 8 project

A project based on Bootstrap4, DOM manipulation with JS, AJAX, JSON and API.

### Background: 
    You are a junior developer in the IT department of a major banking company. Until now, the core target group of this bank has been older savers, who do not use the internet very much. It now wants to diversify its customer base, enter the digital age and offer its users a renewed online banking service in order to attract new users. However, banking is a business of trust and it is the security of users that must come first.  
    As such, you need to create an application that allows the user to create and manage bank accounts.

### Functional specifications :
    - On the site's home page, the user sees all his bank accounts by default 
    - When he arrives at the home page, a layer is displayed over the entire page and reminds him of the essential security rules on a website. The security rules are stored in a file and retrieved by HTTP (AJAX) request 
    - On a statistics page the user accesses banking information such as loan rates, stock market price, etc... This information is retrieved from a file via HTTP request and presented in table form. This information is stored in a file in JSON format. 
    - A blog page, which will display articles retrieved from the following API: https://oc-jswebsrv.herokuapp.com/api/articles
